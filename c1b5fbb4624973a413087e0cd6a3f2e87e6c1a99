      "message": "We strongly recommend against enabling DEVMEM on your system.  If you need DEVMEM support temporarily we have DEVMEM_BOOTPARAM enabled, which you can trigger through the u-boot command line.\n\nDEVMEM usually leads to people writing unmaintainable scripts to poke at random BMC chip registers and it becomes very difficult to debug where something went wrong.  It also has some security implications that make it undesireable.",
